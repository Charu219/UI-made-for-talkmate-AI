      Talkmate AI does more than just practice conversations—it becomes your personal English trainer. 
      Once you start a dialogue, our AI listens carefully to your speech and analyzes it in real time. 
      When you finish, simply click <strong>Stop</strong> and instantly receive a detailed breakdown.
    </p>

    <p>
      You’ll see the <strong>difference between what you spoke and what you should have spoken</strong>. 
      The platform highlights grammar errors, missed vocabulary, and pronunciation slips. 
      Each corrected sentence comes with an <strong>audio playback button</strong>, so you can hear the correct version 
      and compare it with your own. This helps you understand both grammatical accuracy and fluency in spoken English.
    </p>

    <p>
      To make learning more effective, Talkmate AI also detects your <strong>fluency score</strong>, measuring pauses, filler words, and speed. 
      If you are not satisfied with your attempt, click <strong>Redo</strong> and the same conversation will restart, 
      allowing you to practice repeatedly until you gain confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      We’ve made the experience even more innovative. 
      If you provide a topic, Talkmate AI will generate teacher-like questions and <strong>speak them aloud</strong>, 
      guiding you through interactive learning. For group practice, it can simulate a <strong>group discussion</strong>, 
      placing you in a virtual circle of participants. And if you’re preparing for a job, 
      our <strong>HR interview trainer</strong> asks professional questions and gives constructive feedback to improve your performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      With Talkmate AI, feedback is not just a correction—it’s a complete <strong>learning journey</strong> that adapts to your goals.
