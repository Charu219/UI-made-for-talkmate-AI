      One of the biggest challenges in learning English is <strong>speaking naturally and clearly</strong>. 
      Talkmate AI’s <strong>Audio Correction</strong> feature ensures that you not only say the right words, 
      but also say them with the right fluency and pronunciation.
    </p>

    <p>
      After completing your conversation, each corrected line is paired with an <strong>audio button</strong>. 
      When you click it, Talkmate AI reads the corrected version aloud in a natural human-like voice. 
      You can then compare it with your own attempt and notice differences in tone, speed, and accent.
    </p>

    <p>
      This feature allows you to <strong>redo and repeat</strong> the same conversation until your pronunciation and fluency match the AI’s guidance. 
      It acts like a pronunciation coach who never gets tired of correcting you.
    </p>

    <p>
      For advanced learners, Talkmate AI can also act as a <strong>teacher</strong> that asks you questions on any topic you choose. 
      You respond, the AI analyzes, and then plays back the corrected version. 
      In <strong>Group Discussion mode</strong>, multiple voices are simulated so you practice fluency in a realistic setting. 
      And for professionals, the <strong>HR Interview mode</strong> ensures you speak with clarity, confidence, and correct pronunciation.
    </p>

    <p>
      With continuous listening, comparing, and repeating, you’ll gain the fluency and confidence needed 
      to communicate effectively in English.
